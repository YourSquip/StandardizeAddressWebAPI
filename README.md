# StandardizeAddressWebAPI
.NetCore WebAPI + dadata 


So the main idea was to form a POST request to dadata get that json and return it in GET request.  

But I wasn't able to send correct POST request to dadata (for some reason)(actually that was 400 failed to read request)  

But I setted up everything else so you can look up at it separately through POST and GET requests in OPENApi
